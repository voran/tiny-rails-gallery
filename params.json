It requires no database to run, but instead craws a pre-configured folder to find photos and thumbnails.\r\nGenerating thumbnails is outside the scope of this project. To generate scaled-down versions of images for fullscreen display and thumbnails, you are advised to use a fast, third-party tool such as ImageMagick directly from the command line.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nClone this repository. Then:\r\n```sh\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nConfiguration for this application is stored in config/application.rb\r\n\r\n### Title and Meta Tags\r\nYou can set title and meta tags using the following entries:\r\n```rb\r\n    config.title = \"My Web Gallery | Tiny Rails Gallery\"\r\n    config.meta_description = \"Powered by Tiny Rails Gallery\"\r\n    config.meta_keywords = \"Gallery\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Content\r\nPictures and thumbnails need to be in folders accessible under public/. You can also set up symlinks that point to folders outside the web application. Set these entries\r\n```rb\r\n    config.photos_url = \"/photos/\"\r\n    config.thumbnails_url = \"/thumbnails/\"\r\n```\r\n to point to the folders (or symlinks) relative to pubic/ where your content is stored.\r\n \r\nTiny Rails Gallery walks the thumbnails folder and picks a random image to use as thumbnail for each folder. If no images are found in a folder and its subfolders, a \"no preview\" image is shown. You can configure the location of the \"no preview\" image using the following config:\r\n \r\n```rb\r\n    # No cover image location (relative to public/ folder)\r\n    config.no_cover_image = \"/img/no-cover-image.jpg\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, You can whitelist file types and blacklist directories using the following entries:\r\n```rb\r\n    config.blacklist_dirs = [\".\", \"..\"]\r\n    config.whitelist_file_types = [\"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"png\", \"gif\", \"bmp\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Google Analytics\r\nTo enable google analytics for your new gallery, put your Google Analytics code in config/environments/production.rb\"\r\n```rb\r\n    # Enable Google Analytics\r\n    GA.tracker = \"<your GA Code here>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nReleased under the [GPL 3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nThe JavaScript image preview is based on  [blueimp/Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery/) JS library.\r\nLayout based on  [twitter/bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).\r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
